# Customized Dropdown Controller

This is Customized Dropdown Controller which is an option to UIPickerView. 
This is basic and effective approach to make a dropdown using UITableView. 
For Dropdown's look and feel added UIViewAnimation to UINavigationItem.

Steps to create Dropdown:
- On Intended ViewController (on StoryBoard) create UITableView with height constraint 0 and connect it to appropriate outlet for UITableView.
  Connect appropriate Outlets and add CustomDropdownVC class to ViewController 
  (Important:Set CustomDropdownVC as Class for ViewController).
- I have triggered dropdown on UINavigationItem you can replace it by any UI Component alike UILabel , UIButton.

I hope this will helps.
